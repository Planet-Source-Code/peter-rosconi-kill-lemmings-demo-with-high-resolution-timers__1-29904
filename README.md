### Description

This is a demo program showing how someone could make a lemmings type game. This code uses bitblt with high resolution timers and is quite fast. Note: I do not have any affiliation with the creators of the game Lemmings, nor is this program complete, I just made it for fun.

CCRP Timers are included.
 
### More Info
 
Must install ccrp timer activex control. See http:www.mvps.org/ccrp/

Slow computers could crash.
